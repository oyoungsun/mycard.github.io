                of a working-class family negotiating not only its food budget but also
                the effect on that budget of the time constraints of working parents,
                so too did the early environmentalism movement sometimes pay too little
                attention to the financial effect of environmentally responsible behavior.
                Recycling was an easy win because wartime rationing had conditioned people for it,
                and the gains were obvious and short-term. Switching to energy-saving
                lightbulbs is fairly easy to convince people to do, because of their longevity
                and the obvious long-term savings. Reducing water usage is more difficult,
                particularly given how low water bills tend to be relative to other utilities
                ─ a change in behavior may amount to only a few dollars a month,
                and those few dollars may seem like a more-than-reasonable price for longer showers
                and a well-watered lawn. Even water conservation is only asking for a behavioral change,
                however, and perhaps the expense of a low-pressure showerhead.
                Asking people to spend money on going green has historically been difficult.
